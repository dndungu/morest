# REST
REST is an opinionated library for quickly creating RESTful micro services. It is built using lessons learned while architecting micro services systems.

## Event driven architecture
REST encourages using an event broker to send state changes between services.

## Metrics
REST encourages tracking function performance metrics.

## Unit Testing
REST encourages mocking database, metrics client, and event broker to allow for 100% test code coverage in your project.

## Example

```go
// TODO
```
