REST is an opinionated library for quickly creating RESTful JSON APIs.

It allows one to use a database, events stream and metrics client of their choice.

The library is opinionated in that it encourages tracking of metrics, logging and publishing the activities of the API to an event stream.

It also defines a few interfaces designed to better structure the API service project.
